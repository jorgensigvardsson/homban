This is my and my wife's personal pet project: an automated kanboard for chores. It is automated because each task are given a recurrance period. For instance, cleaning windows should be done three times a year, but changing towels should be done once a week.

Why? Because we've got way too much on our hands as it is with a house, three kids, cats, and all what it brings with it. Having a constant reminder of what to do leaves a lot of free space in our collective minds. Win!

This is not a traditional open source project. We do not aim to provide a super cool tool for anyone to use. We do this to solve our particular problems. If you want to use it, great! Just don't expect any support - you're on your own!

That said, if you use this, and you've added some really cool feature that is easily merged back into my source tree, feel free to send me a PR. If it's something that we can use for our daily life, then thank you in advance!
